<h1>About</h1>
<h2 id="about-who">Who: a team of changemakers</h2>
{% call editable.region('about-who') %}
<p>
  A small, scrappy team backed by California Community Foundation has spent the
  last few years punching above its weight class, working to catalog and
  coalesce the open data for and about the 10 million Angelenos in Los Angeles
  County. Since 2013, we have explored, imagined, investigated, researched, and
  dreamed about the possibilities and power of open data combined with
  meaningful stories, all with the aim of establishing the first and only
  platform to gather all of Los Angeles County's open data into one place .
  We've interviewed data journalists and data practitioners, surveyed and spoken
  with data publishers, performed a landscape analysis of data-focused
  initiatives, assembled and curated thousands of datasets, connected with other
  open data proponents, explored opportunities for partnerships, highlighted
  important open data projects across the county, constructed an initial test
  site, run through a series of beta tests, and established an open source, open
  data tool for change. You're welcome.

<h2 id="about-tech">What: our technology</h2>
{% call editable.region('about-tech') %}
<p>
  LA Counts is both a tool for change and a community of changemakers. Free,
  open source, and open data, LA counts is replicable, portable and above all,
  transparent. (Check out our
  <a href="https://hack4laatd.org/blog">blog</a> where we regularly model
  transparency--about our successes as well as our challenges!) With this tool,
  our community works towards tackling pressing issues through data, developing
  dataset standards that benefit Los Angeles County. We also work to unpack what
  we know (and what we don't know) about our region though data stories.
</p>

<p>
  Open data platforms provide the public with powerful lenses through which
  different insights about government and industry models and actions can be
  revealed. Through them publicly available data becomes accessible, data
  providers can be held accountable, and advocates, activists, funders and
  policymakers can make better, more well-informed decisions.
</p>

<p>
  Our current harvesting technique limits us to sharing data from open data
  portals. We'd like to share more: we'd like to highlight publicly available
  private data but we need that data to be hosted somewhere in order to point to
  it. Here's where you, the LA Counts community, come in. Do you have data that
  you'd like to share publicly? Have you made FOIA requests for data? Where is
  is stored?

<p>
  Open source is more than just publicly accessible code, it's a thriving
  culture, a movement that carries with it an ethos of transparency and
  collaboration. The development and extensions work that our community
  accomplishes with CKAN--a global, open source, open data platform--will
  bolster other open source public digital infrastructure that support a free
  and open web.

<h2 id="about-when">When: The time is now</h2>
{% call editable.region('about-when') %}
<p>
  Ultimately, LA Counts is a community tool—built, managed and strengthened by
  the people who use it. In these critical early days, your participation will
  determine the success of this effort. Help by identifying new resources and
  suggesting datasets to add to those already available.
  <a href="/contact">Drop us a note</a> to recommend ways to make this platform
  even more useful. And, of course, share your experiences with others as you
  put LA Counts data to work.

<h2 id="about-where">Where: Los Angeles County</h2>
{% call editable.region('about-where') %}
<p>
  How much do you know about Los Angeles County? Sprawling over 4000 square
  miles, LA County is home to over 10 million residents--our population is
  greater than 42 states. LA County boasts 88 separate cities and numerous
  unincorporated areas. That means we have 88 mayors and 88 separate
  governments. While most people know about LAUSD, unlike other large
  metropolitan areas, we have multiple school districts: 93 of them are spread
  throughout the County. We're also blessed with a population that speaks 200
  different languages. The County is a maze of bureaucracy, filled with hundreds
  of disconnected, overlapping, and sometimes competing agencies working for
  Angelenos. But what does this have to do with data? Read on.
</p>
{% endcall %}

<h2 id="about-why">Why: our needs</h2>
{% call editable.region('about-why') %}
<p>
  Despite its massive population, size and level of need, Los Angeles County is
  arguably the least well funded major metropolitan area in the United States.
  We simply don’t know enough nor do we have enough open data about our county
  to tell its complete story. Without accessible and defensible data, funders
  and decision-makers are hesitant to invest in issues affecting our county and
  everyone misses out. We can change this! Demographic data, poverty statistics,
  educational needs, sub-ethnicities, housing and healthcare scarcity remain
  hidden--masked by the aggregate data of a huge population buried under
  byzantine governmental complexity. The sheer size, complexity and diversity of
  Los Angeles County can be a barrier for funders, policy-makers, journalists
  and activists to the understanding and addressing the needs of the
  under-represented and under-served.
</p>

<p>
  While we know a good deal about Los Angeles County, there is much we don't yet
  know, or can't yet share with our community. Some of the hurdles we face are
  technological, and some of them (perhaps most of them) are bureaucratic. The
  governments of Los Angeles County and the cities within it generate huge
  amounts of data but a surprising amount of it is not publicly available. We,
  along with our community, aim to change that.

<h2 id="about-how">How: a community of datanauts</h2>
{% call editable.region('about-how') %}
<p>
  All this is to say, that as a community and as a site, we're a work in
  progress, entirely invested in building and supporting the data-focused
  community, and although we've tirelessly worked to build and improve LA
  Counts, we're humble about what we've accomplished so far. Like it?
  <a href="/contact">Let us know</a>! Think it needs work? Tell us! Want to make
  change in your neighborhood? Great! Want to influence policy affecting the
  poorest and most vulnerable populations? Get involved and help us make Los
  Angeles County the best it can be!
