<p>
  LA Counts is a free and open source platform of linked and downloadable open
  data resources and related data stories about and for Los Angeles County. LA
  Counts aggregates open datasets and data stories relevant to LA County but
  does not host, store, or own the data on the site. Instead, LA Counts puts
  open data into the reach of advocates and changemakers.

  This site is openly licensed and proof that open data, even for a sprawling
  metropolis like Los Angeles County, can be a motivating factor for civic

  Data can be thought of as a new form of infrastructure, one that governments
  and businesses run on. <a href="https://opengovdata.org/">Open Data</a> are
  datasets that individuals and organizations make publicly available for use
  and or redistribution without legal, technological or social restrictions.
  They provide the public with powerful lenses that can reveal insights about
  government and industry models and actions. With them data providers can be
  held accountable and advocates, activists, funders and policymakers can make
  better, more well informed decisions. LA Counts believes that data should be
  freely available to everyone to use and share as they wish, without
  restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.

  communities of Los Angeles County, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.
  Dedicated to leading social change to benefit all residents, CCF is the
  permanent philanthropic endowment for LA County. LA Counts is proud to have
  them as the originating sponsor of this work.

  What is a dataset?
  <a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-dataset"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>
  A dataset is a collection of data, most commonly in the form of a table,
  available for access or download in one or more formats. Typically, each
  column of the table represents a field or variable and each row corresponds to
  an individual piece of data within the dataset that contains information for
  each field.
</p>

<h3 id="what-do-the-fields-in-the-datasets-mean">

  <a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-the-fields-in-the-datasets-mean"
    ><i class="fa fa-link"></i
  ></a>
</h3>
<p>
  LA Counts encourages the publishing of data dictionaries alongside datasets to
  provide users with context and more details describing the fields and
  variables found in the dataset. If the data publisher has provided a data
  dictionary, it will be available under the Data and Resources section on your
  LA Counts dataset page.

<p>
  LA Counts is proud to provide the ability to see many different LA
  County-centric datasets gathered into one central location: this
  accomplishment has never been achieved before. Datasets come in different file
  formats according to the type of data being stored and the sharing choices
  made by the data publisher. Regardless of the file type, LA Counts encourages
  datasets to be provided in digital, machine-readable formats. For further
  explanation of common file types, please visit the
  <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/appendices/file-formats/"
    >Open Data Handbook</a
  >.

  Why are some datasets so messy?
  <a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-some-datasets-so-messy"
    ><i class="fa fa-link"></i
  ></a>
</h3>
<p>
  LA Counts datasets are presented without alteration or intervention. We
  believe that data quality is important but LA Counts does not own or host any
  of the datasets. Because our datasets are harvested from various publishers
  with unique requirements and needs, some datasets may need to be cleaned.
</p>

  Why is some metadata missing or incomplete?
  <a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-some-metadata-missing-or-incomplete"
    ><i class="fa fa-link"></i
  ></a>
</h3>
<p>
  Unfortunately, it is not a requirement for publishers to fill out every
  applicable metadata field. This leads to missing information in the metadata
  section. Dataset quality and usefulness depends on accurate metadata that
  describes the dataset. LA Counts has created a technique to measure
  completeness: the Metadata Completion Rate (<a
    href="#whats-the-metadata-completion-rate"
    >explained below</a
  >). If you have a concern about this, please let us know
  <a href="/contact">here</a>.

  What’s the metadata completion rate?
  <a class="headerlink" href="#whats-the-metadata-completion-rate"
    ><i class="fa fa-link"></i
  ></a>
</h3>
<p>
  The green or red circle on dataset pages indicates completeness against 12
  required metadata fields. This tool aims to help both data publishers and data
  practitioners to recognize opportunities for improvement as well as discuss
  and address dataset hygiene. Please see our blog post (<a href="NEED LINK"
    >NEED LINK</a
